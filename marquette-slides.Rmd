# Section 1: Getting Started with RStudio

---

# Why learn R?

* It is capable of carrying out basic and complex statistical analyses
* It is able to work with data small (*n* = 30!) and large (*n* = 100,000+) efficiently
* It is a programming language and so is quite flexible
* There is a great, inclusive community of users and developers (and teachers)
* It is cross-platform, open-source, and freely-available

---

# Where to begin

* R is the engine

* RStudio is the steering wheel & the gas pedal

* Can't get anywhere without the engine, but we never interact with the engine directly

* R = language ; RStudio = Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

# Section 2: Packages

---

# Packages

"Packages" are shareable collections of R code that provide functions (i.e., a command to perform a specific task), data and documentation,. Packages increase the functionality of R by improving and expanding on base R (basic R functions). 

---

# See what packages you have
```{r, out.width = "350px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("pkg_example_screenshot.jpg")
```

### Installing and Loading Packages

To download a package, you must call `install.packages()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

You can also navigate to the Packages pane, and then click "Install", which will work the same as the line of code above. This is a way to install a package using code or part of the R Studio interface. 

```{r, out.width = "350px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("install_pkgs.jpg")
```
Usually, writing code is a bit quicker, but using the interface can be very useful and complimentary to use of code. 

---

# Using packages

*After* the package is installed, it must be loaded into your R Studio session using `library()`:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

We only have to install a package once, but to use it, we have to load it each time we start a new R session.

> A package is a like a book, a library is like a library; you use library() to check a package out of the library

##########Maybe delete this - decide if Vignettes & Functions are Essential right now

# Vignettes

Vignettes are long-form documentation (and tutorials) that can provide a helpful introduction to a package.

Run `vignette()` in order to view *all* of the vignettes available for a package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
vignette(package = "dplyr")
```

Then, you can load a specific vignette.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
vignette("dplyr", package = "dplyr")
```

These are also available through CRAN (i.e., https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html)
---

# Using a specific function

If you know the specific function that you want to look up, you can run this in the R Studio console:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?dplyr::filter
```

Once you know what you want to do with the function, you can run it in your code:

```{r}
dat <- # example data frame
  tibble(letter = c("A", "A", "A", "B", "B"),
         number = c(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 5L))
filter(dat, letter == "A")
```
