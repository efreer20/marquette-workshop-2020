# Section 1: Getting Started with RStudio

---

# Why learn R?

* It is capable of carrying out basic and complex statistical analyses

* It is able to work with data small (*n* = 30!) and large (*n* = 100,000+) efficiently

* It is a programming language and so is quite flexible

* There is a great, inclusive community of users and developers (and teachers)

* It is cross-platform, open-source, and freely-available

---

# Where to begin

* R is the engine

* RStudio is the steering wheel & the gas pedal

* Can't get anywhere without the engine, but we never interact with the engine directly

* R = language ; RStudio = Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

---
# Code with me:

Open R Studio cloud

---
# IN PROGRESS What's what in RStudio

  - Where data lives
  - Where code lives
  - Need to save code files
  - What are the unique factors of working in a cloud computing environment

# Quick guide to notation in R

* <- is the assignment operator. It means "save as"

* %>% is the "pipe" operator. It means "then"

* # is the comment operator. It means "ignore this"

* () are how we give sub-commands to R. We might give R a command and then use () to give more specific instructions.
---
# Notation: <-
Using the assignment operator, we can save a changed dataset
```{r}
data <- data

```

---
# Notation: %>% 

```{r}
```

---
# Notation: #
 
```{r}
```
---
# Notation: Putting it all together
<- 
%>% 
#
()
```{r}
#Some example that incorporates all symbols
```

# Section 2: Packages and Functions

---
# Packages

"Packages" are shareable collections of R code that provide functions (i.e., a command to perform a specific task), data and documentation,. Packages increase the functionality of R by improving and expanding on base R (basic R functions). 

---

# See what packages you have
```{r, out.width = "350px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("pkg_example_screenshot.jpg")
```

---
# Installing and Loading Packages

To download a package, you must call `install.packages()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

You can also navigate to the Packages pane, and then click "Install", which will work the same as the line of code above. This is a way to install a package using code or part of the R Studio interface. 

```{r, out.width = "350px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("install_pkgs.jpg")
```
Usually, writing code is a bit quicker, but using the interface can be very useful and complimentary to use of code. 

---
# Using packages

*After* the package is installed, it must be loaded into your R Studio session using `library()`:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

We only have to install a package once, but to use it, we have to load it each time we start a new R session.

> A package is a like a book, a library is like a library; you use library() to check a package out of the library
> - Hadley Wickham, Chief Scientist, R Studio

---
# Vignettes

Vignettes are long-form documentation (and tutorials) that can provide a helpful introduction to a package.

Run `vignette()` in order to view *all* of the vignettes available for a package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
vignette(package = "dplyr")
```

Then, you can load a specific vignette.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
vignette("dplyr", package = "dplyr")
```

These are also available through CRAN (i.e., https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html)
---

# Using a specific function

If you know the specific function that you want to look up, you can run this in the R Studio console:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?dplyr::filter
```

Once you know what you want to do with the function, you can run it in your code:

```{r}
dat <- # example data frame
  tibble(letter = c("A", "A", "A", "B", "B"),
         number = c(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 5L))
filter(dat, letter == "A")
```

# Section 3: Loading Data

---
# Where does my data "live"?

* Need to tell R where to look for your data

* This is called a Working Directory

* We can specify the working directory with our mouse

* We can also specify the working directory with code

* For now, it makes sense to store your data in the same place as your code

######IN PROGRESS 
#IDEAS 

#basics of functions
  - Assignment operator
  - arguments
  - functions
  - check out data types
  
#Package fundamentals: my favorite packages & my workflow
  #High level overview: 
      - tidyverse for data cleaning
      - skimr to check out the data
      - 
      
  #Example of an end-to-end data analysis I did in R (maybe at work)
    - what packages I used
    - how I got from point A to point B

# Section 4: Processing Data

#Task: Check out the data
  str(data) gives us an overview of the types of all of the data columns at once

Try typing this code:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
str(data)
```
